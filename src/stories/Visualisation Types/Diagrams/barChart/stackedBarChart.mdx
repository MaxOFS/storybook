## Description
A Stacked Bar Chart is a simple way of showing part-to-whole relationships but can be difficult to read with more than a few components. The size of the components is more effective to read in a stacked bar chart than in a pie chart because it is a surface comparison. A stacked bar chart uses color differences to show several dimensions. To do this, each bar is split into a set of dimension items, distinguished by color, while maintaining the total bar length. A Stacked Bar chart is presented with horizontal bars. A horizontal layout is the best choice for long text labels and trends, whereas a vertical layout is the best choice for short labels and trends.

### Axis starts at 0
Diagrams must always start at 0 otherwise the perception is distorted (unless the diagram represents an index, in which case the 100 value is mandatory). Deviations are allowed if the interruption is clearly marked. 
### Horizontal layout
All charts with long labels, have to be rotated by 90° to be compatible with small screens (mobile). 
### Sort unordered categories by metric
Appropriate sorting, which is almost always based on a metric, is important to effectively convey information in a bar chart and increase readability.
