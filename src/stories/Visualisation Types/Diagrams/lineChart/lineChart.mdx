## Description
A line chart is used to display changes in values for one or more variables. It is made of points which are connected by a line. It generally displays a change over a period of time but is also used to visualize distributions with a large amount of data (ex: normal distribution by Gauss). The X-axis usually represents a continuous (often time) quantitative variable. The Y-axis represents a numerical value.
