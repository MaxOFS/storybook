## Description
An area chart is used to visualize changes to a metric value over time. Because it has only one metric, it serves the same function as a simple line chart. An area chart is distinguished from a line chart by the addition of shading between lines and a baseline, like in a bar chart.

### Area chart with diverging areas
A Diverging Area Chart will present a standard area chart but with a diverging display of the data around a Base-line or Zero-line. It is used to compare values and to highlight 2 directions in the data over a single dimension. It should be used when the data includes negative and positive values. A diverging area chart however will have a zero-line or base-line with diverging areas on each side, which can in turn be highlighted by diverging colors. The shaded area of these charts allows a balance to be shown – either against a baseline or between two series.
