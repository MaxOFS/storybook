## Description
A Categorical scatterplot typically displays the values of two variables, in order to show their relationship. When the third variable is qualitative, it can be shown with a difference in shape or color. The data is altogether displayed as a collection of points.

The values of the first variable will determine the position of the points along the horizontal X-axis, and the values of the second variable will determine their position along the vertical Y-axis. The third variable is shown with a difference in shape or color.
