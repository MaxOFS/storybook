## Description
A Bubble Chart is used to look at the relationships between three numerical variables. The first and second variable will be plotted in function of values along the X and Y-axes as a scatterplot. The third variable will determine the size of the points, and therefore their respective weight. It is important that the value of the third variable corresponds to the area of the bubble and not its diameter. In order to avoid hiding the small circles with the overlaying of big circles, it is mandatory to plot the smallest circles in front of the larger ones.
