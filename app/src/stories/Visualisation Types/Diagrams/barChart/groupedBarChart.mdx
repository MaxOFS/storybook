## Description
A Grouped Bar Charts is used when two or more data sets are displayed side-by-side and grouped together under the same categories. It is a standard way to compare the size of things, and it allows to compare multiple series. However, it can become tricky to read with more than 2 series. The horizontal layout is the best choice for long text labels and trends. Grouped bar charts can group the categories on the same axis.

## Do's and don'ts
### Axis starts at 0
Diagrams must always start at 0 otherwise the perception is distorted (unless the diagram represents an index, in which case the 100 value is mandatory). Deviations are allowed if the interruption is clearly marked. 
### Horizontal layout
All charts with long labels, have to be rotated by 90° to be compatible with small screens (mobile). 
### Sort unordered categories by metric
Appropriate sorting, which is almost always based on a metric, is important to effectively convey information in a bar chart and increase readability.
