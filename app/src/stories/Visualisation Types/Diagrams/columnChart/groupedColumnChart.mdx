## Description
A Grouped Column Chart is used when two or more data sets are displayed side-by-side and grouped together under the same categories. It is a standard way to compare the size of things, and it allows to compare multiple series. However, it can become tricky to read with more than 2 series. The vertical layout is the best choice for date/time. Grouped column charts can group the categories on the same axis.
